afunction [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

%Initializaiton of the variables used
N = size(X,1);
numOfFeat = size(X,2);
mu = zeros (1,numOfFeat);
sigma = zeros (1,numOfFeat);
X_norm = zeros(N,numOfFeat);

mu = % mean of each column (feature)

sigma = % standart deviation of each column
X_norm = % normalize each column independently
